# Filter Implementation using OpenCV

* We build a real-time capture window that provides a glimpse of fundamental image filters like Blur, Canny, etc. 
* We used OpenCV for implementing filters & Deep learning face detection model to locate faces with high precision.

* Filter Selection :

Press B/b : Blur Mode
Press C/c : Canny Edge Detector Mode
Press F/f : Face Detection Mode
Press P/p : Back to Preview Mode
Press Esc : To terminate code

* Note : Upload 'DNN' files into Jupyter Notebook & suggested to run code within Jupyter Notebook as opencv library inbuilt in it.
